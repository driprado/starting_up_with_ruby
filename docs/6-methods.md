# Methods Definition and Declaration

## Method definition

Ex: [`6_method_definition_declaration.rb`](../code/6_method_definition_declaration.rb)

```bash
def great_technologists_list
    puts ["Marissa Mayer", "Katherine Johnson", "Margaret  Hamilton"]
end

# Output:
None, you have to declare the method to call it.
```

## Method declaration

```bash
great_technologists_list

# Output:

Marissa Mayer
Katherine Johnson
Margaret  Hamilton
```

Ruby functions return what a value from a method even without the word `return`
But if the word return exists within a method, the compiler stops there.
